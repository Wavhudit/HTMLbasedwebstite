            <cite>Tuesdays with morrie</cite> was the very first book I ever read outside of my studies. It was recomended by
            a friend who to this day holds a special place in my heart. I downloaded the book on  
            my phone and read it on an 8 hour trip to Limpopo from Johannesburg. This book changed 
            my whole life. I transformed from an almost robotic like someone and 
            trully came to know what it means to be a human being. It made me more human.
