            <cite>The richest man in babylon</cite> is the book I read by listening to 
            the audiobook. The narration of the book was soo goood that I would spend 
            atleast an hour everyday listening to it. It is the book that tought me 
            how to manage my finances. The way the lessons were delivered in the book 
            is just out of this world!
